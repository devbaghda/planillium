<!--
  Facts not derivable from code alone at a glance — architecture reference, schema, and format
  documentation kept verbatim. Header = lookup anchor (not a line number). Never compacted, no
  size ceiling. Tidy, not append-only — update CONTEXT.md §4 Section Index when a header changes.

  Migrated 2026-09-14 from the pre-split CONTEXT.md (verbatim content, reorganized only).
  DECISIONS.md (business rules + standing lessons) was NOT folded in here — it's a mature,
  independent register that predates this scheme (split 2026-08-04) and stays where it is; see
  CONTEXT.md's header note for why.

# Domain knowledge — Planillium

## Display name and internal rename history
_2026-09-14_

**Display name is "Planillium"** (renamed 2026-07-08; the app was originally internally called
Mentor-Overseer). The repo folder, GitHub repo, and C# namespace were all still `MentorOverseer`
for a while after the display-name rename — kept that way deliberately at first (internal,
invisible to users) — but the user confirmed wanting a full internal rename too now that the app
is public, done 2026-07-23: project folders/csproj files are
`winui/Planillium.App`/`winui/Planillium.App.Tests`, the C# namespace is `Planillium.App`
throughout.

**Three deliberate exceptions**, all legacy-compatibility values that must keep referencing *old*
name(s) for existing-install migration/cleanup: `AppInfo.LegacyStartupRegistryValue` +
`CredentialStore`'s `LegacyService` (so an existing TickTick token isn't orphaned),
`StartupService.LegacyNames` (registry Run-key sweep — also lists `"Mentor-Overseer"`/
`"NetherlandsMentor"` from even earlier names), and `release/installer/app.iss`'s
`DelRunKeyLegacy1`/`Legacy2`/`Legacy3` entries (mirrors the same list). Compiled exe:
`Planillium.App.exe`.

## App architecture — the WinUI app is THE app
_2026-09-14_

`winui/Planillium.App` started as a Python/Tkinter app (`main.py`), was fully rebuilt in WinUI
3/.NET 8 over 2026-07-06/07, and the Python source was removed from the repo on 2026-07-08 once
the WinUI app had shipped everything it did (still recoverable from git history/tags if ever
needed). See "Project history (pre-WinUI, Python/Tkinter era)" in `context/todos.md` for what that
era delivered.

## Tech stack
_2026-09-14_

- **Framework:** WinUI 3 / .NET 8 (`net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0`), Windows App SDK 1.8.260529003
- **Build:** `dotnet build -p:Platform=x64 -c Release` from `winui/Planillium.App/` —
  no Visual Studio required. Unpackaged, self-contained (`WindowsPackageType=None`,
  `WindowsAppSDKSelfContained=true`), no admin rights needed.
- **Database:** SQLite via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`
- **Tray:** H.NotifyIcon.WinUI — close hides to tray, tracking keeps running
- **Activity tracking:** P/Invoke `GetForegroundWindow` + `GetLastInputInfo` (Windows)
- **TickTick:** REST API (OAuth2), own `TickTickAuth`/loopback listener on 8765
- **Credentials:** Windows Credential Manager (`CredentialStore`, python-keyring-compatible
  byte format)
- **Packaging:** Inno Setup via `release/release.ps1` (see `release/README.md`)
- **App name constant:** `AppNames`, `AppInfo.MaxActivePlans = 3` (raised from 2, 2026-08-13)

## Plan JSON format
_2026-09-14_

```json
{
  "id": "kebab-case-slug",
  "name": "Plan title",
  "color": "#0a84ff",
  "start_date": "2026-06-29",
  "total_days": 160,
  "briefing": { "high_leverage": [...], "ignore_completely": "...",
                "common_time_wasters": "...", "realistic_timeline": "..." },
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase": 1,
      "name": "Phase Name",
      "tasks": [
        { "day": 1, "task": "Task title", "detail": "...", "mentor_note": "...",
          "category": "profile", "duration_min": 60, "tools": ["VS Code", "Chrome - Coursera"] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
Required fields: `id`, `name`, `phases`. `mentor_note` (per task) and `briefing`
(plan-level) are what drives the app's "mentor" UI (💡 note under a task, MENTOR'S
NOTE in Details, 📋 Briefing button) — a plan imported without them just won't show
mentor commentary; that's a content gap in the source JSON, not a bug. `tools` (per
task, added 2026-07-28) is the list of specific apps/tools/websites that task needs —
`AddPlanDialog` teaches every distinct one to `config.json`'s `activity_rules.on_plan`
list right after a real (non-queued) import (`ConfigService.LearnActivityRule`, same
mechanism the Diary's manual "mark on-plan" bulk action already used), with a short
confirmation dialog naming what was learned. The "Add Plan" wizard's 3 prompt templates
(`Services/PlanTemplates.cs`) ask Claude to include `mentor_note`, `briefing`, and
`tools` (the Reformat template only fills `tools` where the user's own source text
actually implies a specific tool, matching its existing "don't invent content" rule).

## Database schema (data/progress.db)
_2026-09-14_

```sql
task_completions (id, plan_id, plan_day, task_text, completed, completed_at, last_updated)
  UNIQUE (plan_id, plan_day, task_text)
task_overrides   (plan_id, task_text, original_day, assigned_day)  PK (plan_id, task_text)
  -- reschedule / move-to-today / day-off all write here; "insert don't overlap" shift semantics
plan_days_off    (plan_id, day, marked_at)  PK (plan_id, day)
task_notes       (plan_id, task_text, note, updated_at)  PK (plan_id, task_text)
  -- personal scratchpad per task, inline-editable on Today/Schedule; empty note deletes the row
score_ledger     (id, ts, date, delta, reason, detail)
  -- UNIQUE(reason, date) for reason IN (daily_score, overdue_accrual, weekly_comeback_bonus)
reflections      (id, date UNIQUE, text)          -- evening review answers
ticktick_sync    (id, plan_day, task_text, ticktick_task_id, ticktick_proj_id, pushed_at, synced_at)
  UNIQUE (plan_day, task_text)
time_diary       (id, date, start_time, end_time, duration_min, category, window, description)
  -- category: on_plan | off_plan | neutral | idle | paid
diary_daily_rollup (date PK, on_min, off_min, neutral_min, paid_min, ...)
  -- written just before a day's raw time_diary rows age out (90-day retention, user-
  -- configurable in Settings), keeps
  -- Year-view totals accurate forever after per-entry detail is gone
```

## config.json key fields
_2026-09-14_

Working hours (which are also the diary window — `DECISIONS.md` business rule 1),
reminder/idle timing, `ticktick.client_id` (secret/tokens are in
Credential Manager, never here), `activity_rules` (on_plan/off_plan/neutral keyword
lists), `scoring` — all 12 keys now listed once in `Services/ScoringRules.cs`, which is the
single source of their defaults, ranges and Settings labels; the formula, the config lookup
(`ConfigService.ScoringRate(key)`) and the Settings SCORING section all read from that table,
so an absent key behaves exactly as the old hardcoded default did —, `score` (points_per_minute/
points_per_currency_unit/currency_symbol — the "buy entertainment time" economy),
`idle_activity_rules` (idle-dialog answer → category reclassification, the user
populates via Settings), `appearance.theme_mode`,
`late_day_task_reminder_hours` (added 2026-07-20, default 2.0 — how long before
`end_of_day_summary_time` the once-a-day "tasks still open" toast fires). Edited via
the in-app Settings dialog, which writes this file and restarts the activity tracker.
